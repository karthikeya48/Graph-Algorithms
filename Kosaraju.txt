Kosarju works only in directed graph.
  
To find : The number of the strongly connected components and color them up.
Strongly connected component :  The subset of vertices were there is an direct path between these nodes.

Main idea behind the algorithm: 

Consider topo-ordering of an graph.

if 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 is an topo order then it means that 1 should come before 2 in the dfs traversal.

if 2 is the parent of 1 and 2 is not in front of 1 in the topo order then there is an cyclic path between 1 and 2, which says the both  1 and 2 are of part of the single SCC.
The reverse adjacency list is formed to find the parent of the node.
